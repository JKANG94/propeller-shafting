# The matlab program of the combined beams

## Introduction

A new modeing method for the dynamic analysis of the propeller-shafting system was proposed. 

The blade and shaft were simplified as Timoshenko beam, and they were connected by spring.

## Tutorial

two-dimension: in-plane model

three-dimension: space model

blade with torsion: space model and consider the torsion of blade
